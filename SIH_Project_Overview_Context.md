### **Data Flow Example: Emergency Response**
1. **Tourist enters restricted area** → GPS coordinates sent to API Gateway
2. **Geofence Backend** detects polygon breach using Turf.js spatial analysis
3. **AI Engine** analyzes movement pattern, confirms anomaly (risk score > threshold)
4. **Blockchain Service** immutably logs incident with timestamp and location
5. **Alert System** triggers multi-channel notifications:
   - Tourist receives immediate push notification
   - Nearby authorities get WhatsApp/SMS alerts with location
   - Dashboard shows real-time incident with response options
6. **Authority responds** → incident status updated → tourist notified of help dispatch

## **DEVELOPER CONTEXT SUMMARY**

You are building a **life-saving technology platform** that addresses a critical gap in India's tourism safety infrastructure. Your module contributes to a system that could potentially **save lives, prevent crimes, and boost tourism confidence** through cutting-edge technology integration.

**Key Development Principles**:
- **User-centric design**: Every feature must work intuitively during emergency situations
- **Real-time reliability**: System must perform when seconds count
- **Scalable architecture**: Design for national deployment from day one
- **Security-first approach**: Tourist safety data requires highest protection standards
- **Demo-driven development**: Every feature must be demonstrable to judges

**Your individual module** is a critical component in this integrated safety ecosystem. While you focus on your specific implementation, always consider how your work enables the complete user journey from tourist registration through emergency response to incident resolution.

**The ultimate success measure**: A working system that judges can see protecting a tourist in real-time, with full transparency and auditability through blockchain technology.
